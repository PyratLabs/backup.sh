# backup.sh

### Version 1.1.5

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PyratLabs/backup.sh.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PyratLabs/backup.sh)

Pure bash implementation backup script for GNU/Linux, BSD and UNIX.
backup.sh can put encrypted backups on local or remote servers.

## Specification

Extendible, general purpose backup script written in bash. Compresses,
encrypts and copies to remote.

All scripts and plugins are written in bash and are checked against
[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/), max columns of 80 characters to
ensure easy editing over SSH session.

Currently creates backup files with one week retention with the following
pattern:

`/path/to/backup/$(hostname)/$(date "+%A")`

Further development will look at different retention periods including
weekly and monthly backups.

    and puts it in the backup directory for encryption.

### Remotes

Shell script wrappers to synchronize backups to a remote server.

  * `plugins/remote/s3.sh` - Remotely syncs the local backup directory to
    AWS S3.
  * `plugins/remote/rsync.sh` - Remotely syncs the local backup directory to
    a chosen rsync target.
